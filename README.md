# nudged<sup>1.0.0</sup>

A JavaScript lib to estimate translation, scale, and rotation between two sets of 2D points. Applicable for example in cases where one wants to move objects by multiple fingers or where a large number of points from an eye tracker device are wanted to be corrected based on a few calibration points. In general, you can apply *nudged* in any situation where you want to move a number of points based on a few sample points and optionally a fixed pivot point.

Mathematically speaking, *nudged* is an optimal least squares estimator for [affine transformation matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation) with translation, rotation, and uniform scaling, and without reflection or shearing. The estimation has time complexity of O(*n*) that consists of *6n+22* multiplications and *11n+19* additions, where *n* is the cardinality (size) of the point sets. Under the constraint of a fixed pivot point, the number of operations is even smaller. In other words, *nudged* solves an affine 2D to 2D point set registration problem (alias [Procrustes superimposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrustes_analysis)) in linear time.

The development of *nudged* has been supported by [Infant Cognition Laboratory](http://www.uta.fi/med/icl/index.html) at [University of Tampere](http://www.uta.fi/en/) where it is used to correct eye tracking data.

Available also [in Python](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nudged).



## Example app

To get a grip on how the transformation looks and how the points affect it, play with the [interactive example app](https://rawgit.com/axelpale/nudged/master/example/index.html).

## Install

    $ npm install nudged



## Usage

Let `domain` and `range` be point sets before and after transformation i.e. the training data:

    var domain = [[0,0], [2,0], [ 1,2]];
    var range  = [[1,1], [1,3], [-1,2]];

Compute an optimal transformation based on the points:

    var trans = nudged.estimate(domain, range);

Alternatively, set a fixed pivot point that should not be altered in the transformation. You can think it as a pin or anchor:

    var pivot = [3,3];
    var pivotedTrans = nudged.estimateFixed(domain, range, pivot);

Examine the transformation matrix:

    trans.getMatrix()
    -> [[0,-1, 1],
        [1, 0, 1],
        [0, 0, 1]]
    trans.getRotation()
    -> 1.5707... = Ï€ / 2
    trans.getScale()
    -> 1.0
    trans.getTranslation()
    -> [1, 1]

Apply the transformation to other points:

    trans.transform([2,2])
    -> [-1,3]

Inverse the transformation:

    var inv = trans.getInverse();
    inv.transform([-1,3])
    -> [2,2]



## API


### nudged.estimate(domain, range)

Compute an optimal affine transformation from the domain to range points.

**Parameters**
- *domain*: array of [x,y] points
- *range*: array of [x,y] points

The *domain* and *range* should have equal length. Different lengths are allowed but additional points in the longer array are ignored in the estimation.

**Return** new *nudged.Transform(...)* instance.


### nudged.estimateFixed(domain, range, pivot)

Often one point, e.g. a corner of a picture, needs to stay put regardless of the domain and range.

**Parameters**
- *domain*: array of [x,y] points
- *range*: array of [x,y] points
- *pivot*: [x,y] point

The *domain* and *range* should have equal length. Different lengths are allowed but additional points in the longer array are ignored in the estimation.

**Return** new *nudged.Transform(...)* instance.


### nudged.version

Contains the module version string equal to the version in *package.json*.


### nudged.Transform(s, r, tx, ty)

An instance returned by the *nudged.estimate(...)*.

In addition to the methods below, it has properties *s*, *r*, *tx*, *ty* that define the [augmented transformation matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation#Augmented_matrix):

    |s  -r  tx|
    |r   s  ty|
    |0   0   1|

#### #transform(points)

Apply the transform to a point or an array of points.

**Return** an array of transformed points or single point if only a point was given. For example:

    trans.transform([1,1])           // [2,2]
    trans.transform([[1,1]])         // [[2,2]]
    trans.transform([[1,1], [2,3]])  // [[2,2], [3,4]]

#### #getMatrix()

**Return** an 3x3 augmented transformation matrix in the following array format:

    [[s,-r, tx],
     [r, s, ty],
     [0, 0,  1]]

#### #getRotation()

Get clockwise rotation from the positive x-axis.

**Return** rotation in radians.

#### #getScale()

**Return** scaling multiplier, e.g. `0.333` for a threefold shrink.

#### #getTranslation()

**Return** `[tx, ty]` where `tx` and `ty` denotes movement along x-axis and y-axis accordingly.

#### #getInverse()

**Return** a new `nudged.Transform` instance that is the inverse of the transformation.

**Throw** an `Error` instance if the transformation is singular and cannot be inversed. This occurs if the range points are all the same which forces the scale to drop to zero.
